## What is a "Genetic Algorithm"?
  * Traditional GA (Search)
  * Interactive Selection
  * Evolutionary "Ecosystem" Simulation

## Terminology
  * Darwinian Evolution: Heredity, Variation, Selection
  * population
  * genotype vs. phenotype
  * fitness function
  * crossover
  * mutation

## History
  * While computer simulations of evolutionary processes date back to the 1950s, much of what we think of as genetic algorithms (also known as “GAs”) today was developed by John Holland, a professor at the University of Michigan, whose book [Adaptation in Natural and Artificial Systems](http://amzn.to/2nsSIYw) pioneered GA research.
