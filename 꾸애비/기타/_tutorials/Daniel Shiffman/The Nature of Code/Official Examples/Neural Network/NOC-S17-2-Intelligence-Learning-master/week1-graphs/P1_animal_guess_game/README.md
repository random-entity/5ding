# AnimalGuessingGame

This idea comes from my kids (5 and 8) who like to play the "Animal Game" with an Amazon Echo.  The "guesser" asks a series of yes or no questions to try to guess the animal the player is thinking of.   There is a [reddit programming challenge](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/34asls/20150429_challenge_212_intermediate_animal_guess/) on this same topic.  This is also related to the topic of [Decision Trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree) which I hope to cover in a video tutorial soon.

Requirements:
* [node.js](https://nodejs.org)
* [readline-sync](https://github.com/joshuapinter/readline-sync)

To run, launch terminal (or equivalent):

```
$ node animalgame.js 
```

I would like to make this into a chat or twitter bot or web application at some point and also improve its sophistication / features.  Any help appreciated!
