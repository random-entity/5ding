The Nature of Code Part 2 (Spring 2017)
======================================

Syllabus for Part 2 of Nature of Code: "Intelligence and Learning" at ITP Spring 2017

This syllabus is very much in progress. I'm drawing inspiration from this [Coding Train community list of resources](https://github.com/CodingTrain/Machine-Learning).

Prerequisites?
-------------
* Basic familiary with [p5.js](http://p5js.org) and [Processing](http://processing.org).
* Fundamentals of computer programming, equivalent to [ICM](https://github.com/ITPNYU/ICM-2016)
* While taking [Nature of Code Part 1](https://github.com/shiffman/NOC-S17-1-Physics-Animation) is not required, I recommend you familiarize yourself with the following chapters before the first day of class.
  * [Chapter 1: Vectors](http://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-1-vectors)
  * [Chapter 2: Forces](http://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-2-forces)
  * [Chapter 3: Oscillation and Trig](http://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-3-oscillation)
  * [Chapter 6: Steering Behaviors](http://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-6-autonomous-agents)
* I assume no knowledge whatsoever about AI, machine learning, deep learning and the accompanying math required for the algorithms listed below. After all, I barely know this stuff myself.
